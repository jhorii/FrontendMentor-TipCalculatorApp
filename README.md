## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I'm pretty old school with most of my HTML and CSS so flexbox/grid are pretty new for me.  So this project was to get some experience with that.

My JS is also pretty amateur so this was a good project to improve upon that.

Most of my work, I don't have to create custom form fields so developing a custom validation message was good and also playing with some of the form field settings.  The little things like setting the field to "number" or setting a minimum value make a big difference in the usability.

I made sure that when clicking a text box that it would highlight the text on-click (at least for android.....)

### Continued development

I still need work on Javascript/CSS/HTML but this is a good start.  Most of what I need to improve upon is not relying on looking up how to do something.  That is very time consuming and inefficient.
